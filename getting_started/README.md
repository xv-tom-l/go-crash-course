# Getting Started
There are a lot of Golang tutorials and books available on the Internet. Most of them are free. As a senior software engineer, you shouldn't find it's difficult to learn Go programming with these resources by yourself.

## Task for the week
* For complete beginner, finished this Go Tour
https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

* Then read this book: [Learning Go](http://miek.nl/go/) and [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

* Then read the Go code review guidelines: https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments

* To find documentation of Go packages (stdlib and 3rdparties), always go to [godocs.org](https://godoc.org/) first

* To find interesting Go project, go to: https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go

## Goal
By the end of this week, you should be able to:

* Complete simple projects in Go
* Write unit tests
* Understand the strength and weakness of the Go. And when to use Go and when to not use Go.

## Notes

* Everyone goes through 'why doesn't Go have ____' or attempts to write Go in the style of their previously favorite language. It takes a while to learn the 'go way' of doing this.
* If you must read [this document](https://golang.org/ref/mem) to understand the behavior of your program, you are being to clever. Don't be clever
* Always formatting your Go code
